# Updating the Website - Tutorial  
* All `code` is to be executed in the terminal/command line.
- The website uses javascript to take data CSVs and automatically construct the webpages. The following pages are currently updatable by editing the CSVs:

    + [**Team](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/RajLab_website/tean.html): 
        - `Team.csv` = All past and present members on the *Team* page. Members are automatically assigned to different sections depending on their "Status" column ("PI", "active", "student", or "alumn").  

    + [**Publications / Presentations**](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/RajLab_website/publications.html): 
        - `Publications.csv` = All publications on the *Publications / Presentations*  page. This file is used for both the "Section View" and "Datatable View".  
        - `Presentations.csv`: All presentations on the *Publications / Presentations*  page.  
    + [**Data / Software**](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/RajLab_website/data.html):  
        - `Data_Software.csv` = All data and software generated by the lab or through collaborations. Includes links to each dataset/tool and the associated article.
    
    + [**Funding**](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/RajLab_website/funding.html):
        -  `Grants.csv`: All grants awarded (active and past).  

- All other pages must be updated by editing the HTML files. A good IDE is recommended to do this; I reccommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) combined with the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), to see how your edits change the website in real-time.
- If you want to edit the Navbar or the Footer, you only need to edit the `navbar.html` and/or `footer.html` files in order to propogate these changes to the whole website.

<br><br>

1. **Clone GitHub Repo**  
    - Go to the location on your computer where you want to copy the repo:  
    ```sh
    cd <desired_folder_location>
    ```  
    - Clone the repo (*only necessary the first time*):  
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/RajLab_website.git
    ```  

2. **Edit CSV Files**  
    - The CSVs are located in the subfolder `documents`.
    - Open these files in Excel, add new rows, and save the file (without changing the name or extension):
        + *Important!*: Aside from entering new rows, you must keep the exact same table structure. Do NOT edit the number or names of columns as the javascript code uses these.

3. **Push Changes to GitHub**
    - Make sure you're within the `RajLab_website` folder:
    ```sh
    cd RajLab_website
    ```  
    - Stage changes: 
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```  
    - Commit changes:  
    ```sh
    git commit -m <write_commit_message_here>
    ```  
    - Push changes to GitHub: 
    ```sh
    git push
    ```

<br>

- And voil√†! Your website will now be updated, all with no or minimal HTML coding:
    + **Note**: You may have to wait a little bit for all the changes to fully appear in the website (GitHub Pages can take some time to update).
