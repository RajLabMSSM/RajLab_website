Active,R01AG054005,Raj,NIA,04/01/2017 - 03/31/2022,The Role of Peripheral Myeloid Cells in Alzheimer's Disease,"The goal of this research is to identify functional genetic variants that contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to understand the innate immune mechanism by which these variants act to cause disease. Our proposed work may explain the causes of AD and have the potential to lead to the development of blood-based, biomarkers and new therapeutic targets for AD."
Completed,-,Raj,The Michael J. Fox Foundation,11/01/2017 - 10/31/2019,The Role of Peripheral Myeloid Cells in Parkinson's Disease,"The goal of this project is to characterize the transcriptome profiles of peripheral monocytes of Parkinson's disease patients, and to resolve functional genetic variants using expression quantitative trait locus mapping."
