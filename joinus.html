            <p class="h"> Computational Genomics Postdoctoral Fellow </p>
            <p class="b">The Raj Laboratory at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is seeking a computational postdoctoral fellow. The qualified candidate should be highly motivated, with experience in human genomics, computational biology, RNA biology, neuroscience, or a related field. He or she should have experience analyzing genomic and transcriptomic datasets derived from high-throughput sequencing technologies. Experience with RNA-Sequencing tools and methods are a big plus. A good understanding of genetics is required. Because the work involves multiple collaborators, a good balance between independence and team spirit is essential, and effective communication skills are necessary. Candidates are required to have a Ph.D. degree. This position is mentored by Dr. Raj working under the broader leadership of Drs. Alison Goate, Eric Schadt, and Eric Nestler.<br><br
               <strong><em>Qualifications</em></strong>
               <li>Candidates should have a Ph.D., M.D. or equivalent doctorate in a quantitative field such as statistical genetics, biostatistics, bioinformatics, computer science, or a related discipline.</li>
               <li>Candidates should have proficiency in programming (e.g. Perl, Python or C/C++) and statistical computing (e.g. R).</li>
               <li>Candidates should have a track record of scientific productivity and/or leadership.</li>
